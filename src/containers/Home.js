          <p>We are a non-profit organisation supporting refugees with the dream of becoming developers.</p>
          <p>In their journey of interrupted lives, unfinished studies and integration challenges, many asylum seekers and refugees
          yearn to update their tech skills, but lack learning opportunities. <strong>We want to change this.</strong></p>
          <p>We have launched a 6-month web development programme in London, coached by a group of professional developers.</p>
          <p><strong>This is just the beginning.</strong> In the coming months we will be expanding our programme to other regions
          and cities.</p>
