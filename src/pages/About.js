      We are a non-profit organisation supporting refugees with the dream of
      becoming developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In their journey of interrupted lives, unfinished studies and integration
      challenges, many asylum seekers and refugees yearn to update their tech
      skills, but lack learning opportunities.{' '}
      <strong>We want to change this.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year we launched the first cohort of our 6-month web development
      programme, coached by a group of professional developers. Today we are
      running new classes in London and Glasgow. This is{' '}
      <strong>just the beginning</strong>. With your help we will be expanding
      to other regions and cities.
